## Service Account

Service Accounts can be created without any project-scope permissions 
(Step2 whhen creating a new service account: Grant this service account access to project (optional))

We can service accounts to any particular resource (managed individually in each resource's dashboard). 
For example, creating a service account and then grant accesses to that account for a storage bucket.
