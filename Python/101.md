### Use `help` function to display the documentation of modules, functions, classes etc.

If no parameter is given, the interative help system starts on the interpreter console.
```
help()
```

For module/class functions, you can pass the `module_name.function_name` or `object.function_name` just like when you want to invoke the function.

Example, both `help(str.split)` and `help("".split)` work in the same way.

### Use `with` to let Python interperter automatically takes care of closing any opened files.

Without `with`:
```python
try: 
  file = open("FILE_NAME", "w")
  doSomething
except IOError as error: 
  doSomething
finally:
  if 'file' in locals():
    file.close()
```

Using `with`:
```python
try: 
  with open("FILE_NAME", "w") as file:
  doSomething
except IOError as error:
  doSomething
```

### Use `strip` method to remove unwanted spaces from string (beginning and ending spaces)

### The `file` argument to the print() controls where data is sent to

### The `str()` can be used to access the stringed representation of any kind of data object that support conversion

### The `locals()` returns a collection of variables in the current scope

### The `in` operator tests for membership
```python
if 'data' in locals():
  data.close()
```

### The `+` operator concatenates 2 strings

### `sys.stdout` is Python's standard output and is available from the standard libraryâ€™s sys module.

### The `pickle` module lets you easily and efficiently save and restore Python data objects to disk.

### The `pickle.dump()` function saves data to disk.

### The `pickle.load()` function restores data from disk.
