## CPU architectures

### macOS

- x86_64: is the architecture of Intel's 64-bit CPUs, sometimes also simply referred to as x64. It is the architecture for all Intel Macs shipped between 2005 and 2021.
- arm64: is the architecture used by newer Macs built on Apple Silicon, shipped in late 2020 and beyond.

### iOS and iPadOS

- arm64: is the current 64-bit ARM CPU architecture, as used since the iPhone 5S and later (6, 6S, SE and 7), the iPad Air, Air 2 and Pro, with the A7 and later chips.
- armv7s: (a.k.a. Swift, not to be confused with the language of the same name), being used in Apple's A6 and A6X chips on iPhone 5, iPhone 5C and iPad 4.
- armv7: an older variation of the 32-bit ARM CPU, as used in the A5 and earlier.
- armv6: very old iOS devices shipped before 2009 had armv6 CPUs, which are no longer supported by current iOS SDKs.
